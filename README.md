# Test task

Encoder-decoder architecture (RNN/LSTM/Transformer-based) for number sorting.

## Comments
This is an interesting problem, more as an intellectual challenge than as a really practical solution (the existing algorithms for sorting, Quicksort and so on, are surely going to be faster and do not need the previous training time). I can think of (as the statement suggests) architectures for series.
