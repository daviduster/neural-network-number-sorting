# Test task

Encoder-decoder architecture (RNN/LSTM/Transformer-based) for number sorting using only numpy. Implementation correctness checked with a gradient checker.

## Comments
This is an interesting problem, more as an intellectual challenge than as a really practical solution (the existing algorithms for sorting, Quicksort and so on, are surely going to be faster and do not need the previous training time). I can think of (as the statement suggests) architectures for series.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
